To solve this question, we envisaged the problem to be related to n-queens.  Just like in n-queens, we first try to meet one of the 
constraints (the heavier ones), then the next and so on.  Also, we assume throughout that k>m>n. The problem formulation is as below:

Initial state:  We consider each student to be a single group.  Thus, if there are n students, then there are n groups.

State space:  The state space would be the combination of all the students to form a team in various ways, such that the 
team size is not more than 3.  

Successor function:  We consider the student with the highest cost and try to pair him with his 
preferences.  So, at any instant, the student being worked upon is the one who has the maximum cost.  

Edge weights: Each group costs k minutes, each student takes a single minute if he is allocated a team size that he didn't prefer, 
`n` minutes per person if assigned to someone they didn't request and `m` minutes per person if assigned to someone they do not want to work with. 

Goal state: A set of groups of students such that their total cost would be lesser than that of the threshold. 

Working of the search algorithm:
    The algorithm initially treats each student to be an individual group.  Thus, if there are `n` students, then there are `n` groups.  
Next, it finds out the student(s) with the maximum cost and tries to form groups as per his preferences.  While doing this, it does not bother 
if other students want to (or do not want to) work with this student because we assume that k>m>n.  Once this group has been formed, it calculates 
the total cost.  If this total cost is less than the threshold (initially set equal to 1), then it simply exits; if not then it increments the 
threshold by some pre-defined value (say 10) and then again calculates the cost for each student.  Note that the value of `k` is not used in this 
case (and it is used later on after forming the final groups).  Once the costs for each student have been found, it again selects the highest 
student and starts forming groups as per his preference.  Then it again calculates the total cost to find if it is less than the threshold, if 
yes then exits; if not then increments the threshold and iterates.  It finally exits the iteration when the total cost it found is lower than 
the threshold in that case.

    Once the loop is exited, it finds to see if there exists any student (like Steflee) who has not been paired up with.  If yes, then it pairs 
such a student with some other group (provided the group size<=2).  It then finally calculates the total cost (also taking into account `k` 
this time).  The groups thus formed are displayed alongwith the total cost.

    This approach works and generates the lowest possible cost because we increment the threshold in each iteration.  Thus, the threshold 
acts as an upper limit to the minimum cost that it needs to find.  It uses a hardThreshold set to a very high value to ensure that the search 
does not run to infinity.  

Assumptions and challenges faced:
    We assume that k>m>n.  Thus, throughout the code, we try to maximize the number of groups and to pair up the students with their preferences.
The main challenge we faced was trying to determine a goal state (since the program could literally find a max value every time and keep 
iterating).  It is then that we decided to come up with the threshold factor to ensure that we have an upper bound on the minimum cost that 
is found.  Besides this, we also have a hardThreshold set to a very high value to ensure that the search doesn't run to infinity.  We also 
initially thought about the brute force approach of pair students in all possible ways, but quickly determined that it would be very expensive 
and might not run even for relatively small number of students.  There after we envisaged it to be similar to n-queens problem and 
employed a similar thought process for solving it.
